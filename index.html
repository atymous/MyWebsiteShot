                    <h4>A little more about me</h4>

                    <p>I don’t know who I am, but I’ve narrowed it down to multiple possibilities. I know that I have an unhealthy relationship with the genre of horror, that I enjoy being physically active, that I love painting and creating, although there is more, currently, I’m someone who is in search of guidance and experience.</p>

                    <p>I attended a Charter Art School named, “Oakland School for the Arts”, where I practiced my emphasis, Traditional Media (4 hrs/day), throughout Middle School and High School. My graduating class consisted of 66 students, most, if not, all my friends chose to pursue their Art career, and I was determined to succeed in the Engineering field. For as long as I can remember, I’ve always wanted to succeed with both being creative by continuing my practice of art, and being creative by designing/implementing tools as an Engineer, but I didn’t know how.
                    </p>

                    <p>I decided to stick with attending a smaller college and attended UC Merced, where I got a real taste of the UC’s academic courses. Lord and behold, after struggling through those years, I finally made it and graduated with a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science and Engineering! I was able to gain communication skills and take interesting courses, such as; Introduction to Object Oriented Programming, Database Systems, Computer Architecture, and Software Engineering. Sadly, the pandemic occurred during my last semester in college, resulting in a lack of experience and knowledge, as well increasing the difficulty of landing an opportunity in the field. Welp, then a challenge it shall be!</p>

                    <p>After graduating as of May 2020, I continued to apply to Software Engineering, Data Analysis, Web Automation, and Front-End Developer opportunities, and the outcome was unsuccessful. Rejections were, or should I say, still, dive into my emails, and honestly I’m happy that I received replies at all! Luckily, I received an interview for an unpaid internship from WeCare Insurance, which I immediately took! I’ll gladly take any offer of guidance as I need experience and want to know what opportunities lie ahead of my path.
                    </p>

                    <p>During my time at WeCare insurance I became part of the Web Automation team where I implemented code to perform web scraping using Selenium and Java. My team lead and I implemented automation scripts to handle the execution test requirements of three different home insurances. The idea was to utilize the user's required form information to create new quotes and output the cheapest option available between the three insurances. We used sendKey() and click Javascript operations, and scraped certain data elements that we needed to utilize from Trulia and Redfin. 
                    </p>

                    <p>While I was trying to gain as much experience as I can, I continued to work part-time jobs, apply for more opportunities in the CSE field, and try to complete Python/Javascript Udemy courses. Then I came across a young lady on YouTube named, ”Gweneth Pena”, who spoke about the “Cloud”, and more specifically the cloud computing market, Amazon Web Services (AWS). I couldn’t believe I never even considered learning about a tool that I unknowingly use everyday. I was never introduced to this topic in college, and it took one search to have my mind lost in the sauce about how widely used AWS is. Even Netflix, a streaming service, and another content platform I use daily is hosted on AWS.</p>

                    <p>After doing more research, I immediately noticed the future of migrating from on-premise data centers to the Cloud, the amount of guidance when it came to educating myself on how to use their platform, how environmentally friendly it is, and the variety of opportunities. Right then and there, I decided to pursue my path to become a Cloud Engineer in hopes of one day becoming a Solutions Architect and communicating with sales and/or customers, designing solutions to achieve company goals, having a variety of tasks, while being sustainable.</p>

                    <p>I recently completed Stephane Maarek’s “Ultimate AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner” course on Udemy, and used AWS Whitepapers as study material to help me pass the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner exam. I scheduled my exam for January 28th through PSI, but to my dismay I was unable to take it during my scheduled time due to the lack of proctors caused by the pandemic. Luckily I was able to take the exam on February 8th and passed! Certifications may not mean a lot to others, and I know experience means everything, but the feeling of getting certified for a high-level knowledge of AWS services was beyond satisfactory.</p>

                    <p>Currently, I’m studying for the AWS Solutions Architect certification. I’m utilizing Stephane Maarek’s “Ultimate AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate 2021” course on Udemy, along with introductory labs from QwikLabs, A Cloud Guru, and 100 Days of Cloud (GitHub) in hopes of not only passing the exam, but to also gain more hands-on experience. Soon I will be refreshing my knowledge of python and javascript, and will continue to keep track of any labs I attempt on GitHub. Although small, at least I can say I’m a baby step ahead of where I was yesterday!</p>

                    <p>Thank you for making it this far and getting to know a little more about me. If you have any junior or entry-level Cloud Practitioner positions please don’t hesitate to contact me, or if you want to know more about me and virtually chat with some tea or coffee, that works for me too! I definitely need to improve communicating again since I’ve been sealed away during the pandemic. Thank you so much for your time and I hope you and your loved ones are all safe.</p>
