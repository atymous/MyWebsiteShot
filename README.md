# MyWebsiteShot

This is me taking another shot at building my own website for my resume, although small I still have to do this! Although I'm a great artist on the paper it's completely different when it comes to designing the layout of the interface, luckily I was able to follow along one of Traversy Media's videos to learn about "Flexbox" and "Grid", contact forms, changing color themes, and much more! I actually heard about AWS S3 when it came to storing our files in buckets, which is also why I am currently studying for the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner exam. If you have any junior/entry-level cloud practitioner positions, please feel free to contact me, I genuinely just want to learn how to apply my knowledge after graduating, thank you! 

# What is "Flexbox"?
A flexible container that can wrap down onto another row independently, giving it a "stone work" kind of look. Therefore this is also considered to be one-dimensional. Has a unique feature to push things away and create room/space.

# What is "Grid"?
A container that can either declare the size of the row to place everything as we choose giving it an "ordered" look, or to wrap down onto another row independently by declaring "auto filling". Therefore this is also considered to be one-dimensional. Grid is also better at overlapping if you want items placed on overlapping grid lines, and grid is also more "sturdy" when considering space occupying features.
